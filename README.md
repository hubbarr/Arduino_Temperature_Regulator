Arduino Controlled Temperature Regulator

This is a temperature regulator that uses a DS18B20 waterproof digital probe to measure the temperature and based off of that measurement the arduino decides if it should turn on a heater or a fan. The arduino is interfaced with a processing file which allows the user to set the desired temperature via a potentiometer.
